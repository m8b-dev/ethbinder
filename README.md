# Ether Binder ‚ö° Your PHP Gateway to Ethereum

Unchain the full potential of Ethereum in PHP. Send transactions, tap into RPCs, and even generate ABI bindings just
like you would with [geth's abigen](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/tools/abigen). Built for modern PHP 8.2!

## üöÄ Features
- **Modern PHP**: Utilizes PHP 8.2 features for cleaner, more robust code.
- **ABIGen**: A PHP counterpart to geth's ABIGen for contract bindings.
- **Ethereum Types**: Custom objects like `Hash`, `Address`, and more.
- **RPC Support**: Range of RPC methods to talk to Ethereum nodes.
- **Strongly Typed**: No more guessing games. Type hinting all the way.

## üîß Requirements
- PHP 8.2+
- Composer 2.2+

## üíæ Installation

Just use Composer. Install the beta version for now.

```shell
composer require m8b/ether-binder:v0.1.7-beta
```

## üìñ Documentation

- **Quick Start**: Grab code snippets from [examples](examples).
- **Read About Components**: Check out the [docs](https://m8b-dev.github.io/ether-binder/) for the full docs.

## üöß Status

> **Caution**: The library is still in its pre-release stage. Perfect for tinkering but not ready for prime time.

### A Note on JSON Keystore

Due to performance constraints with scrypt in PHP, JSON keystore support is a library, which requires `scrypt` pecl extension.
